# Import

Grabbing some cleaned up data

```{r}
housing <- read_csv("data/housing_bc.csv")
housing
```

# Visualize

## Your turn

Write code to imitate the plot at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/statistics/infoline/infoline-2017/17-146-price-new-housing

![](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/statistics/infoline/infoline-2017/price_new_housing_1117.png)


```{r}
ggplot(data = housing) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = total, color = geography))
  
```

The plot still needs some polishing, we'll work on that in 06-Polishing-plots.
