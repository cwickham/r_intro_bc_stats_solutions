```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
housing <- read_csv("data/housing_bc.csv")

diamonds_plot <- ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) 
```

## Your turn 1

```{r}
basic_plot <- housing %>%
  filter(geography %in% c("Canada", "British Columbia (12)")) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = date, y = total)) +
    geom_line(aes(color = geography))
basic_plot
```

## Your turn 2

I've applied the diamond labels to the housing price plot.  Edit the code to add appropriate labelling to the house price plot.

```{r}
basic_plot + 
  labs(title = "New Housing Price Index, Canada and B.C.",
       subtitle = "Total (house and land)",
       x = "",
       y = "NHPI (December 2016 = 100)",
       color = "",
       caption = "Source: Statistics Canada CANSIM table 327-0056"
  )
```

## Your turn 3

Add a theme to basic_plot. Try a few and pick one you like.

```{r}
basic_plot + theme_classic()
```


## Your turn 4

Add a brewer scale to the basic_plot.

```{r}
basic_plot + scale_color_brewer()
```


## Your turn 5

Choose a better color palette for the brewer scale.

```{r}
basic_plot + scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

## Your turn 6

Put the labels, theme and scale changes together for basic_plot.

What is left to change?

```{r}
basic_plot +
  labs(title = "New Housing Price Index, Canada and B.C.",
       subtitle = "Total (house and land)",
       x = "",
       y = "NHPI (December 2016 = 100)",
       color = "",
       caption = "Source: Statistics Canada CANSIM table 327-0056"
  ) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```


## Final plot

```{r}
basic_plot +
  labs(title = "New Housing Price Index, Canada and B.C.",
       subtitle = "Total (house and land)",
       x = "",
       y = "NHPI (December 2016 = 100)",
       color = "",
       caption = "Source: Statistics Canada CANSIM table 327-0056"
  ) + 
  theme_classic() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%b-%y") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.75, 0.2))
```

## Takeaways

Every visual element on a ggplot plot can be controlled.  The most frequent changes you want to make are to:

* Labels, `+ labs()`
* Themes, `+ theme_bw()`
* Scales `+ scale_*_*()`
