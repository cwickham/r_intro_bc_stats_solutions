## R Notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

R code goes in **code chunks**, denoted by three backticks. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd/Crtl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Add a new code chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd/Ctrl+Option+I*.

Here's a not very interesting chunk of R code:
```{r}
2 + 2
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Assigning variables

What's the difference between the code in this chunk:
```{r}
filter(mtcars, cyl == 4)
```

And the code in this chunk?
```{r}
four_cyls <- filter(mtcars, cyl == 4)
```

The difference in the code is `four_cyls <- `.  In the second chunk, rather than returning the output of `filter(mtcars, cyl == 4)`, the output is stored (or "assigned") to a variable called `four_cyls`.  `<-` is the assignment operator, it assigns the output of the right hand side into a variable with the name of the left hand side. 

## Function syntax

Take a look at this code: 

```{r}
heights <- pull(.data = starwars, var = height)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

1. What functions are being called?
2. What arguments do they take?
3. What values are being passed as which arguments?

In the first line, the function `pull()` is being called where the `.data` argument takes the value `starwars` and the `var` argument takes the value `height`.

In the second line, the function `mean()` is being called where the first argument takes the value `heights`.  You would have to look at the help for `mean()`, (i.e. `?mean`) to find out that this first argument is called `x`.  The other argument being provided is `na.rm`, set to the value `TRUE`.

Can you guess what the code does?  `starwars` is a dataset that comes with the `dplyr` package, try `?starwars` to learn more about it.  The code chunk above pulls out the heights of the starwars characters in that data, then finds the mean of those heights ignoring any missing values.  

## Syntax gone wrong

1. There was missing closing parenthesis `)`.
    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    sd(pull(.data = starwars, var = mass))
    ```
    Notice how here we have one function, `pull()` nested inside another one, `sd()`.  The result of `pull(.data = starwars, var = weight)` is passed into `sd()` as the first argument.

2. The string was closed with a single quote `'` rather than a double quote `"`
    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    my_name <- "Charlotte"
    ```

3. The `.data` argument to `pull()` wasn't expecting a character string, remove the quotes around `starwars` to fix the problem.
    ```{r, error=TRUE}
    pull(.data = starwars, var = height)
    ```
