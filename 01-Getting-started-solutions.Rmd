## R Notebooks

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

R code goes in **code chunks**, denoted by three backticks. Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd/Crtl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Add a new code chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd/Ctrl+Option+I*.

```{r}
2 + 2
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Assigning variables

What's the difference between the code in this chunk:
```{r}
filter(mtcars, cyl == 4)
```

And the code in this chunk?
```{r}
four_cyls <- filter(mtcars, cyl == 4)
```

## Function syntax

Take a look at this code: 

```{r}
heights <- pull(.data = starwars, var = height)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

1. What functions are being called?
2. What arguments do they take?
3. What values are being passed as which arguments?

## Syntax gone wrong

```{r, error=TRUE}
sd(pull(.data = starwars, var = weight) 
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
my_name <- "Charlotte'
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
pull(.data = "starwars", var = height)
```
